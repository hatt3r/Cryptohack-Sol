### converting ascii characters to readable string

we use python coding for this

mentioning the array in array
then for every value in the array join it after converting the ascii to char

so the final string will be attached to each other of conversion

we use chr() function to convert ascii to char

and hence the FLAG = "crypto{ASCII_pr1nt4bl3}"
