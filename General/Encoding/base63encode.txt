### encoding using base64

problem statement states that we should first convert the hex string to bytesand then convert the resultant ascii using encoding with base64

python has base64 package which we import and then use its function b64encode on it


hence we get the FLAG = "crypto/Base+64+Encoding+is+Web+Safe/"
