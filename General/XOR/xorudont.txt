### either know xor xor u dont


problem statement states that we should decipher the text with a key that is unkown to us

so we create python program just to guess that key 
we first convert the cipher from hex to bytes
as the hint was given as to remember the flag format we should xor with 'crypto{'

xoring bytes from the secret and crypto{ we get the key 'myXORke'

now we create another python program to calculate the flag

we use the key in bytes form so b'myXORke'


xoring each bytes with key bytes using enumerate and end='' to wrap around the bytes if too long

we get flag = "crypto{1f_y0u_Kn0w_En0uGH_y0u_Kn0w_1t_4ll}"


otherwise use encode and decode function from pwn package from xor
