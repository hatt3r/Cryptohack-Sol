### using xor properties


problem statement gives

KEY1 = a6c8b6733c9b22de7bc0253266a3867df55acde8635e19c73313
KEY2 ^ KEY1 = 37dcb292030faa90d07eec17e3b1c6d8daf94c35d4c9191a5e1e
KEY2 ^ KEY3 = c1545756687e7573db23aa1c3452a098b71a7fbf0fddddde5fc1
FLAG ^ KEY1 ^ KEY3 ^ KEY2 = 04ee9855208a2cd59091d04767ae47963170d1660df7f56f5faf


we have to use its xor properties to figure out the flag 

to find key2 we first have to convert key1 hex to bytes and then use asscociative property 
xoring key1xor2 with key1 to get key2
similarly key2xor3 with key2 from earlier operation to get key3

now we find the key1xorkey2xorkey3 value which is simply xoring key1 key2 and key3 while also converting from hex to bytes 


we find the flagbytes by xoring flagxorkey1xorkey2xorkey3 and key123 that we got from earlier
decode function to get from bytes

hence we get the FLAG = "crypto{x0r_i5_ass0c1at1v3}"
