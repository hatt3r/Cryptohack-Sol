### iteration for each byte from given

problem statement states we should find the flag by iterating each byte from the hex string and xoring



first we convert the the hex string to bytes using bytes.fromhex() function
then we create a for loop iterating possibility from 0 to 99 
and xoring each with the bytes


from a multiple possible values we find the outputs

hence the FLAG = "crypto{0x10_15_my_f4v0ur173_by7e}"
