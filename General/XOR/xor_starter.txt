### xoring the string with


problem statement states that we should xor each character of the string "label" with 13 and print the result as a string


for python we used xor function of the package pwntools

that would be from pwn import xor

printing the xor value would come as 'aloha'

hence the FLAG = "crypto{aloha}"
