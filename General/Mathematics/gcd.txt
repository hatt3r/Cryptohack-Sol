## Greatest common divisor

the problem statement states that we should use euclids method to solve greatest common divisor of any two number

so to find them we create a python program that takes two inputs and use euclids method to find gcd

we create a function called gcd to actually calculate gcd with two inputs a and b
def gcd(a,b):

in that function we create if conditions to check if both are zeros or are divisible by 0 then return

now if a is greater than b then we do a recursive function with gcd(a-b,b) 
otherwise if b isss greater than a then we gcd(a,b-a)

until we get both of them divisible by 0

we take inputs a and b outside this function to test it

if the gcd(a,b) is returning a value then we print it out
otherwise we print("not found")
