## Modular arithematic 1 

we are using congruent mod to find b if  a congruent b to modulo c

we have to mod a and b separately with c to check its congruency

hence we can find b from a mod c

we implement this in python using simple mod operation to a and c 

we get b values for both problems to be 5 and 4 

hence the lowest is 4
