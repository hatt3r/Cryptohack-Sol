## extended euclidean algorithm with gcd

problem statement states that we should find the values of u and v values from the equation
a*u + b*v = gcd(a,b)

for this we create a simple euclidean algorithm to calculate gcd but we update the u and v values along the way

creating a function if a is divisible by 0 then return b ,0,1 
the gcd value as well as u1 and v1 will be recursive function value with inputs of b%a and a

we update the u value as v1-(a//b)*u1
v as u1

we return the gcd value as well as u and v


the driver code will take a and b
value of gcd ,u and v will be given by thefunction gcdextended with the inputs a and b

we print the u and v as well as the gcd value
